> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay

This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable systems:
```java
public class SocialNetwork {
    private Graph<User> userGraph;
    private Map<String, User> userMap;
    
    public void addConnection(User user1, User user2) {
        userGraph.addEdge(user1, user2);
    }
}
```

- Architected a scalable social networking platform in Java
- Implemented optimized CRUD operations with graph-based data structures
- Integrated concurrency primitives for real-time responsiveness
